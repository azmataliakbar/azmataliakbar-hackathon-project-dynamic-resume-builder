// html2pdf.d.ts
declare var html2pdf: any;




/*
Step 1: Install html2pdf.js
You can install html2pdf.js using npm if you're working in a Node.js environment:
npm install html2pdf.js

Step 2: Add Type Declaration for html2pdf
Since html2pdf.js doesn't have official TypeScript types, you need to add a type declaration manually.

Create a new .d.ts file in your project to declare the html2pdf function. You can name it html2pdf.d.ts and place it in the src folder or wherever your TypeScript files are located. */
